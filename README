MediaWiki Extension — Override Entry Title

OverrideEntryTitle is a crude and rather hacky MediaWiki extension to allow
you to override a MediaWiki page name with someone more human legible, for
instance, the page `/wiki/hatom` may be overridden to ‘hAtom 0.3’.

Usage:
-----

This extension adds an `<entry-title>` element to the MediaWiki syntax (named
for its correspondence to marking up entries in hAtom). The content of that
element overrides the default title of the page at render time, and removes
that content from the document body.

Known Issues:
------------

1. This extension disables caching of rendered page content.

To Do:
-----

1. Add a more wiki-esque shorthand syntax (perhaps `!! Page Title !!`)
2. Support caching of the override title and apply the override on every page 
load, not just when the content is parsed.
